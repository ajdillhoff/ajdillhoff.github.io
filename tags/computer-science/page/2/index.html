       Table of Contents Basic Quicksort Performance Randomized Quicksort Paranoid Quicksort Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm implemented in many language libraries that has a worst-case running time of \(\Theta(n^2)\). Why would anyone choose this as the default sorting algorithm if one like mergesort has better worst-case performance? As you will see, the devil is in the details. Quicksort is often faster in practice. It also has a small memory footprint and is easy to implement.

There are two variants, maximum and minimum, and they support the following operations:

Exercise 4.5-2 In the study of Divide and Conquer Algorithms, a recurrence tree can be used to determine the runtime complexity. These notes focus on the master theorem, a blueprint for solving any recurrence of the form
\[ T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n). \]
\(n\) is the size of the problem, \(a \geq 1\) is the number of subproblems, \(b &gt; 1\) is the factor by which the problem size is reduced, and \(f(n)\) is the cost of the work done outside of the recursive calls. Each recurrence is solved in \(T(n/b)\) time, and \(f(n)\) would include the cost of dividing and recombining the problem. The full theorem as described in Introduction to Algorithms is restated below (Cormen et al. 2022).

Problems that can be solved in this manner are typically highly parallelizable. These notes investigate a few examples of classic divide and conquer algorithms and their analysis.

This is fundamental in numerical analysis, where differential equations need to be approximated.
Structured grids are used in finite-difference methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Approximate derivatives can be computed point-wise by considering the neighbors on the grid. As we saw earlier in this course, a grid representation is a natural way to think about data parallelism.

Recall from Lab 1 where we implementing a kernel to blur an image. This kernel worked on each individual output pixel by computing the weighted average of each pixel from the input image, centered on the output pixel location. When we implemented this, we set the weight of every pixel to 1. Whether you were aware of it or not, you implemented a convolution between an input image and weighted kernel.

Memory Coalescing Global memory accesses are one of the largest bottlenecks in GPU applications. DRAM has high latency based on its design. Each cell has a transistor and a capacitor. If the capacitor is charged, it represents a 1. The process to detect the charges in these cells is on the order of 10s of nanoseconds. DRAM can read consecutive groups of cells via bursts. This means that if the data we wish to access is stored consecutively, it can be accessed within the same burst. Contrast that was random access, in which the DRAM will have to make multiple bursts to read the required data. Memory coalescing refers to optimizing our global memory accesses to take advantage of DRAM bursts.

Even though there are thousands of cores that can effectively hide the latency of transferring data to and from global memory, we will see this delay will become a bottleneck in many applications. These notes explore the different types of memory available on the GPU and how to use them effectively.

Each SM has a number of cores that execute instructions in parallel. The H100, seen below, has 144 SMs (you can actually count them by eye). Each SM has 128 FP32 cores for a total of 18,432 cores. Historically, CUDA has used DDR memory, but newer architectures use high-bandwidth memory (HBM). This is closely integrated with the GPU for faster data transfer.

Summary The CUDA Programming model allows us to organize our data in a multidimensional grid. The purpose of this is primarily for our own convenience, but it also allows us to take advantage of the GPU&rsquo;s memory hierarchy. In Lab 0, we only required a single dimension for our grid as well as each block since the input was a vector. When performing computations on multidimensional data like matrices, we can match the dimensions of our launch configuration to the dimensions of our data.

The most important concept is that data parallelism is achieved through independent computations on each sample or groups of samples. The basic structure of a CUDA C program consists of writing a kernel that is executed independently on many threads. Memory must be allocated on the GPU device before transferring the data from the host machine (CPU). Upon completion of the kernel, the results need to be transferred back to the host.

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) MapReduce Overview Hadoop v2 AKA YARN Summary These are my personal notes from the book Fundamentals of Database Systems by (Elmasri and Navathe 2015). I highly recommend reading the original source material. The contents of the article should only serve as a brief overview of the topic.
What is MapReduce? MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel. It was originally developed by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google in 2004 (Dean and Ghemawat 2008). It is based on the functional programming paradigm and is inspired by the map and reduce functions in Lisp and other functional languages. The MapReduce programming model is implemented in the Hadoop framework.
